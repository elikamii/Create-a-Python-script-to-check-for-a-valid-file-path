# Create-a-Python-script-to-check-for-a-valid-file-path
This commit introduces a Python script that validates a given file path. The script includes a function is_valid_path that returns True if the path is valid and False otherwise. This is useful for ensuring user-provided paths are correct before proceeding with file operations.
